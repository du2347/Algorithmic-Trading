# Enhancing Algorithmic Trading Systems with Machine Learning for Adaptive Asset Management

## Executive Summary:
This research project focuses on improving algorithmic trading systems used in the financial industry to manage and automate asset trading. The goal is to enhance existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms capable of adapting to new data, ensuring continued competitiveness in dynamic markets. Leveraging financial Python programming, machine learning, and algorithmic trading skills, we aim to create a robust algorithmic trading bot that learns and adjusts its strategies based on evolving market conditions.

## Objectives: 
For the purpose of this project, there is a fictional scenario; I, as the financial advisor at a top-tier financial advisory firm, engaged in intense competition for managing and automating asset trading within a highly dynamic environment. The firm has experienced substantial profits in recent years by leveraging computer algorithms, enabling faster buying and selling compared to human traders, and establishing an early competitive edge. However, the recognition persists that manually programmed systems have limitations in adapting to new data. Consequently, the participant plans to enhance the existing algorithmic trading systems to overcome these constraints and maintain the firm's competitive advantage in the market. The approach involves strategically integrating machine learning algorithms to augment existing trading signals, ensuring adaptability to new data and sustained profitability in the face of evolving market conditions.
